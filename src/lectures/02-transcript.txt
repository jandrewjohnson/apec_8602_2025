Alright, let's get started. We're missing a few people, but let's begin. Welcome to lecture number two in Applied Earth Economy Modeling. Today, we'll dive into the key topic: introducing Earth Economy Modeling itself.

The agenda for today includes a brief discussion of course requirements and ways to succeed, followed by a deep dive into the reading, which covers the definition, historical emergence, and taxonomy of Earth Economy Modeling. We'll discuss two important examples: AEM and GTAP Invest. Throughout, I'll ask interactive questions and encourage discussion, which is critical for this course.

First, let's discuss expectations and what it means to succeed. We covered the syllabus briefly, but you might wonder if you can succeed in this class. In-person attendance will be required for all credit-seeking members. Many in this class are auditors because this is an emergent research field, and the university allows that. If you are taking this for credit, you must complete assignments and attend in person. If you can't attend, just email me. We can be flexible, but in-person participation is emphasized.

Regarding skills needed, this course does not require much math. Previous versions focused on natural resource economics and were math-intensive, but now, most of that math is in 8601, Economics of Sustainability and Dynamics, taught by Steve Pulaski. This course is more applied, and while math can be applied in code, we will focus on coding examples and problem sets. No prior coding experience is assumed. With tools like large language models, learning to code has become easier. While relying on these tools may mean missing some nuances, I will focus on the essential concepts you need to learn. Syntax issues can be resolved with your preferred language model. If you put in the time, you are likely to succeed.

Discussions will primarily take place in class, with occasional remote participation. Since credit-seeking members will be in person, most discussions will focus on those present. If you are remote and want to participate, please speak up.

Some details, like the midterm date, are still being finalized. If you have questions about succeeding or the syllabus, please ask. The course will primarily use Python, with one day in Julia. Starter code will be provided, and your main programming tasks will involve editing input parameters. Coding is becoming language-agnostic, and once you understand programming concepts, the language matters less. If you have questions or concerns, reach out early.

History will be more relevant in 8601. This course is applied, and while I may occasionally reference math, the emphasis is not on solving Bellman equations or fixed-point theorems. If you are interested in those topics, 8601 is the right course.

Any questions? Anyone feeling confident? I have faith in you all.

The reading is critical and will guide our discussion today. It introduces Earth Economy Modeling. Some authors from our department, including Steve and myself, contributed to it. Becky Chaplin Kramer from the Natural Capital Project was also involved. Annual Reviews asked us to write this paper as an official introduction to the field.

The basic idea is that humans, especially given climate change and biodiversity loss driven by economic activity, are pushing up against planetary boundaries. The lack of models to help navigate decisions and policies in this context is a problem. Traditionally, Earth systems and economic systems have been modeled separately. DSGEs, for example, are removed from the environment. Integrating these systems is necessary.

Early work focused on impacts—how economic outputs like growth affect the environment, such as deforestation or pollution. This approach worked when externalities and common property management were the main concerns. However, as the economy grows and approaches planetary boundaries, dependencies become important—changes in the environment affect the economy. Previously, dependencies were mostly considered in terms of resource extraction, but now, broader linkages are needed.

When writing the paper, we placed Earth Economy Modeling in the existing literature. The first strand is resource allocation over time, such as optimal extraction of minerals or oil, with models like Faustman and Hotelling. These evolved into bioeconomic models, which consider biological resources like fisheries, requiring population dynamics. However, these models were limited to single resources and not linked to the whole ecosystem or economy.

The second strand is valuation—placing a monetary value on environmental goods. Methods like travel cost analysis and hedonic analysis use econometric models to infer the value of nature. Jay Coggins will cover this in 8603. While these approaches are important, they did not emphasize broader connections.

A third area, systems dynamics, came from engineering and optimization, not economics. The Limits to Growth (1972) used computer-based systems dynamics modeling (World3 model) to simulate feedback loops between population, resources, and pollution. Its key conclusion was that unchecked economic and population growth could lead to ecological collapse. This was the first quantitative estimate showing that environmental problems could undercut the natural conditions necessary for economies to continue.

Thomas Malthus argued that populations grow exponentially while food production grows linearly, predicting perpetual scarcity. The Limits to Growth model mathematically expressed this idea, extending it to resources beyond food. The Population Bomb by Paul Ehrlich predicted widespread starvation, but he was proven wrong. Julian Simon, an economist, argued that market responses and human ingenuity would solve resource scarcity. They made a famous bet on commodity prices, which Simon won, though later analyses suggest he may have been lucky.

The development of computer models increased complexity over time. The concept of a computational budget emerged—how much computer time is spent on economic versus environmental complexity. Early models like World3 were small, but as computational power grew, models became more complex, with more sectors and higher resolution.

Our paper introduced a key figure: a frontier with axes for economic and environmental complexity. Models spend computational resources differently, with some focusing on economics and others on the environment. The goal of Earth Economy Modeling is to advance both dimensions, using increased computational resources to build more comprehensive models.

To identify relevant models, we used an algorithm seeded with papers listing models, then searched citations and used a large language model to find similar models. We manually verified each model, synthesizing thousands of papers into 119 relevant models. We also conducted a systematic literature review to confirm our findings, focusing on models with both economic and environmental components, high-resolution representation, code, and documentation.

One subset of models is ecosystem services, a concept popularized at the University of Minnesota. Sustainable human well-being requires accounting for the value of natural capital and ecosystem services. Natural capital refers to the Earth's ecosystems and biodiversity, while ecosystem services are the valuable benefits to humans from that capital. This stock-flow relationship mirrors traditional economic models.

Ecosystem services include provisioning services (e.g., fish, wood), supporting services (e.g., photosynthesis, soil formation), regulating services (e.g., carbon storage), and cultural services (e.g., recreation, aesthetics, education, spiritual connection). The Natural Capital Project, founded by Steve Glaske, developed Invest, a set of open-source ecosystem service models encapsulating consensus science on biophysical processes.

Ecosystem services started one area of research in the frontier of Earth and economic systems complexity. In our paper, we reviewed several types of models: integrated assessment models (IAMs), computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, ecosystem service models, and land use change models. IAMs combine economy and environment, with climate IAMs like DICE focusing on climate mitigation. Comprehensive IAMs add land and other sectors. CGEs and DSGEs focus on economic complexity, with DSGEs solving for optimal allocation over time.

Ecosystem service models assess scenarios but often lack direct links to economic models. Land use change models connect economic predictions to high-resolution land use maps, enabling integration with ecosystem service models. There are also many domain-specific models (hydrology, climate, soil movement) paired with economic questions, representing a frontier for further integration.

As models became more integrated, a key question emerged: how much is nature worth to the economy? One way to express this is the percentage of global GDP attributable to nature. Methods include dependency ratios (e.g., agriculture's dependence on nature) and contingent valuation (surveying willingness to pay for preservation). However, scaling individual values to the whole system raises problems, such as general equilibrium effects.

For example, capturing a diamond-rich asteroid would not make us infinitely wealthy, as the price of diamonds would collapse. General equilibrium models address these effects, providing systematic and theoretically sound estimates of large-scale changes. The GTAP model is a general equilibrium model used for economy-wide modeling.

The World Wildlife Fund commissioned experts to estimate the total value of nature to the economy. Their report recommended linking Invest and GTAP, projecting economic changes, land use change, and ecosystem services, then expressing changes in productivity back into the economic model. This approach embraces general equilibrium, allowing quantitative estimates of nature's value.

A key figure from the report shows that baseline economic forecasts are overly optimistic, missing environmental headwinds. Incorporating ecosystem service changes results in lower growth trajectories, and the difference represents nature's value. This method avoids the pitfalls of scaling partial equilibrium estimates.

The Integrated Economic Environment Modeling Platform (IEM) was developed to capture these dynamics: economy to land use change to ecosystem services, then back to the economy. This was the first model to include non-material regulating and cultural ecosystem services and to compute these linkages at a country scale. The challenge remains to scale these models globally.

Earth Economy Models have five characteristics: global scope, general equilibrium, high-resolution Earth system inputs, high-resolution economic actors, and two-way endogenous linkage between economy and environment. The theoretical framing includes an economic model (e.g., GTAP), land use change model, ecosystem service model, and impacts and dependencies model. The difference in GDP before and after environmental impacts represents nature's value in a general equilibrium framework.

Our research lab developed a model using GTAP, SEALS (land use change), Invest (ecosystem services), and impacts/dependencies pathways. The least developed component is expressing ecosystem service shocks into the economic model. We'll cover these details in future lectures.

Computing global ecosystem services was first achieved in Chaplin Kramer et al. 2019, enabling modeling of impacts at scale. Each ecosystem service (sediment retention, climate regulation, pollination, coastal protection) requires different biophysical pathways and significant computational resources.

The final step is using ecosystem service changes as inputs into the economic model, affecting production efficiency, endowments, and supply/demand shifts. This allows calculation of individual welfare and assessment of impacts on human well-being.

After the World Wildlife Fund's initial project, interest from central banks and ministries of finance grew rapidly. Central banks, responsible for controlling inflation and maintaining system stability, became interested in understanding systemic risks from nature collapse. Our work has been presented to central banks in Chile, Norway, and France, among others. The Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, the largest in the world, is interested in assessing risks to its investments from environmental changes.

This field is exciting and rapidly evolving, offering many opportunities for new research. It is a research topic-rich environment, with many unexplored areas. If you can navigate the complexity, you will find it invigorating and have ample opportunities for publishable work and PhD topics.

For the rest of the semester, we will dive into these models and applied tools. Today's lecture set the framework for this exploration. Thank you for your attention. I'll stick around for questions, and please feel free to reach out with any concerns.

Bye, everybody online!

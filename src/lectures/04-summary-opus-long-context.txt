# Lecture 4: Scenarios for the Future and Land Use Change Modeling

## Introduction and Course Context

This lecture represents a critical transition from theoretical frameworks to specific, quantitative scenarios used in contemporary earth system modeling. Building upon the general framework of scenarios discussed in the previous class, this session focuses on specific datasets and methodologies, particularly those related to land use and land cover change. The assigned readings, Pop et al. (2017) and Hurtt et al. (2020), along with the supplementary Riahi (2017) paper, provide comprehensive coverage of the state of the art in scenario development and land use modeling within those scenarios.

The structure of this session combines theoretical understanding with hands-on application. After discussing the conceptual foundations and specific implementations of global scenarios, students will gain practical experience working with QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) and the Land Use Harmonization version 2 (LUH2) dataset. This hands-on component emphasizes the applied nature of the course, moving beyond mere conceptual understanding to actual tool usage and data manipulation.

Looking at the broader course trajectory, the class has progressed from an introduction to earth economy modeling through an examination of its origins in national sustainability models and general equilibrium approaches. The current focus on scenarios provides the foundation for understanding how models project future conditions. The upcoming sessions will shift toward integrated assessment models for climate change, beginning with William Nordhaus's DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy) model, a foundational yet controversial tool that has been both influential in climate economics and appropriated by climate skeptics to argue against aggressive climate action. The course will also explore the Green DICE Model developed by Frances Moore, which extends Nordhaus's framework to incorporate ecosystem services more comprehensively.

## File Organization and Data Management

Before delving into theoretical content, establishing proper file organization proves essential for avoiding common technical problems that plague computational work. Experience teaching computational courses reveals that the vast majority of programming bugs, particularly for beginners, stem from incorrect file paths rather than conceptual errors. When a program attempts to access a file that doesn't exist at the specified location, it fails, often with cryptic error messages that obscure the simple underlying problem. To minimize these issues, the course employs a standardized file organization system that ensures consistency across all students' computers and enables sample code to function without modification.

The organizational structure follows best practices among professional programmers by utilizing the user directory as the base location. On Windows systems, this corresponds to C:\Users\[username\], while Mac and Linux systems have analogous structures. This approach ensures cross-platform compatibility, allowing code to function identically across different operating systems. Within the user directory, a folder called "Files" serves as the primary workspace, avoiding the clutter that accumulates when storing everything directly in the user directory alongside configuration files from various programs.

Within the Files directory, a BaseData folder houses all course datasets, maintaining the exact folder structure from the shared Google Drive repository. This mirroring of structure means that when downloading files from the shared drive located at NetCap Teams \> Files \> Base Data, students replicate the subsequent folder hierarchy on their local machines. For instance, when downloading a land use land cover map from the path Invest Sample Data \> Carbon, students create these nested folders within their BaseData directory before placing the file in its proper location.

For those using Google Drive Desktop Sync, this folder structure replicates automatically, providing seamless access to course materials. However, manual downloading remains a viable alternative, though it requires careful attention to maintaining the correct folder hierarchy. The importance of this organizational discipline cannot be overstated, as it prevents hours of debugging that would otherwise be spent troubleshooting file path errors.

## The IPBES Framework and Scenario Typology

The development of contemporary scenarios for sustainability science emerges largely from the work of IPBES, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. This organization serves as the biodiversity equivalent of the more widely known IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), dedicated to summarizing current understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem services while combining, funding, and supporting relevant scientific research. IPBES addresses the historical imbalance where biodiversity concerns have received less attention than climate change despite their fundamental importance to human wellbeing.

IPBES gained prominence through the publication by Sandra DÃ­az and colleagues in 2015, which presented a comprehensive conceptual framework for understanding biodiversity and ecosystem services. While the framework itself contains considerable theoretical complexity, one of its most practical contributions involves identifying a useful typology for scenarios that has become standard in the field. This typology distinguishes four fundamental types of scenarios, each serving different analytical purposes.

Exploratory scenarios represent what most people intuitively think of when discussing scenarios. Starting from the current moment with knowledge of historical trends, these scenarios explore the space of possible futures without prescribing specific pathways. For instance, given declining trends in nature's benefits to people, exploratory scenarios investigate various ways this trend might reverse or accelerate, mapping out the landscape of plausible futures without necessarily specifying how to achieve particular outcomes.

Target-seeking scenarios take a fundamentally different approach by starting with a specific desired endpoint and working backward to identify feasible pathways. The Paris Climate Agreement's target of limiting warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius exemplifies this approach. Rather than exploring all possible futures, target-seeking scenarios focus on identifying which pathways could feasibly achieve the specified target while ruling out those that fall short.

Policy screening scenarios, perhaps the most common type in applied sustainability science, evaluate specific policy interventions to assess their effectiveness. Researchers might examine a menu of policy options including carbon taxes, payments for ecosystem services, regulations banning coal use, or various combinations thereof. By modeling these different policy configurations, researchers can identify which approaches most effectively achieve desired outcomes according to chosen metrics.

Retrospective scenarios serve a distinct validation and learning function by examining policies already implemented. These scenarios model what analysts expected to happen before policy implementation, compare predictions to actual outcomes, and analyze discrepancies. This retrospective analysis proves invaluable for calibrating models to reality and understanding why certain policies succeeded or failed relative to expectations.

## The Development of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways

Within the context established by IPBES and in coordination with the IPCC, the scientific community developed the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), a comprehensive set of scenarios for assessing future biodiversity and sustainability challenges. The SSPs, formalized in the major collaborative paper by Riahi et al. (2017), involved multiple research teams and stakeholders working to define scenarios that could serve the broader sustainability community as effectively as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) serve climate science.

The distinction between SSPs and RCPs proves fundamental to understanding contemporary scenario modeling. RCPs focus specifically on climate change, describing trajectories of greenhouse gas concentrations from which climate impacts can be derived. The SSPs, in contrast, encompass broader socioeconomic dimensions including population dynamics, economic development, technological change, and governance structures. This broader scope makes SSPs more complex but also more useful for addressing interconnected sustainability challenges beyond climate alone.

Developing the SSPs required extensive stakeholder engagement to define different storylines or narratives about possible futures. These qualitative narratives then underwent translation into quantitative drivers such as population growth rates, urbanization trajectories, and productivity changes. Policy assumptions are embedded within the scenarios, enabling policy screening analyses within each socioeconomic context. The result provides country-level projections for inputs like GDP and population alongside outputs including energy supply and demand patterns and land use change trajectories.

The SSPs explicitly address both mitigation and adaptation challenges related to climate change and broader sustainability issues. Mitigation challenges refer to the difficulty of preventing climate change through emissions reductions, renewable energy deployment, or other interventions. Low mitigation challenges indicate conditions where reducing emissions proves relatively easy, perhaps due to available technology or political will, while high challenges suggest barriers to emission reductions. Adaptation challenges concern the difficulty of managing climate impacts through infrastructure, technology, or social systems. Low adaptation challenges suggest societies can readily cope with climate impacts, while high challenges indicate vulnerability due to factors like poverty, inequality, or inadequate institutions.

## The SSP-RCP Matrix and Scenario Architecture

Visualizing the SSPs requires understanding their position within a two-dimensional space defined by mitigation and adaptation challenges. SSP1, titled "Sustainability - Taking the Green Road," occupies the favorable position of low challenges for both mitigation and adaptation, representing a world that successfully addresses climate change while building resilient societies. SSP3, "Regional Rivalry - A Rocky Road," represents the opposite extreme with high challenges for both dimensions, depicting a fragmented world struggling with both emission reductions and climate impacts.

The off-diagonal scenarios prove particularly interesting for their contrasting challenges. SSP4, "Inequality - A Road Divided," presents moderate mitigation challenges but high adaptation challenges, representing a world where technological solutions exist but inequality prevents their equitable distribution. SSP5, "Fossil-fueled Development - Taking the Highway," presents high mitigation challenges due to continued fossil fuel dependence but low adaptation challenges due to wealth enabling technological adaptation, creating a techno-utopian scenario where climate change occurs but wealthy societies successfully insulate themselves from impacts through technology like ubiquitous air conditioning.

SSP2, "Middle of the Road," occupies the central position with moderate challenges on both dimensions, often serving as the baseline or business-as-usual scenario for comparative analyses. Each SSP encompasses specific quantitative assumptions about variables including cropland percentage changes, population trajectories, dietary composition including beef consumption, GDP growth, fertilizer use, irrigation expansion, and numerous other factors that collectively define each scenario's characteristics.

The combination of SSPs with RCPs creates a matrix of possible futures, though not all combinations prove equally plausible or useful. RCPs are expressed numerically as radiative forcing levels in watts per square meter, ranging from RCP1.9 (minimal climate change) to RCP8.5 (severe climate change). While these numbers technically refer to radiative forcing rather than temperature, they roughly correspond to degrees Celsius of warming, providing an intuitive understanding of climate severity.

Theoretically, any SSP could combine with any RCP, allowing for scenarios where sustainable development (SSP1) somehow produces high emissions (RCP8.5) or where regional rivalry (SSP3) achieves low emissions (RCP1.9). However, practical and computational constraints limit analysis to marker scenarios representing plausible and policy-relevant combinations. SSP1-2.6 pairs sustainability with low emissions, while SSP5-8.5 combines fossil-fueled development with high emissions. These marker scenarios, while representing a subset of possible combinations, capture the most important and plausible future pathways.

## Integrated Assessment Models and Land Use Projections

The translation from qualitative SSP narratives and quantitative drivers to specific projections requires sophisticated integrated assessment models (IAMs). The primary models used with the SSPs include AIM, GCAM, IMAGE, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM, and REMIND-MAgPIE. These models solve complex optimization problems to achieve objectives like food production and energy provision while minimizing environmental impacts, given scenario-specific assumptions about technology, policy, and socioeconomic conditions.

Most SSP-compatible IAMs employ partial equilibrium approaches, representing certain sectors in detail while treating others as exogenous. This contrasts with general equilibrium models like Nordhaus's DICE that allow full sectoral interaction but with less detail in any particular sector. For example, agricultural models might represent crop production, land use, and food systems in detail while treating energy prices and urban land demand as external inputs rather than endogenous outcomes.

The partial equilibrium approach introduces both advantages and limitations. The detailed sectoral representation enables sophisticated analysis of specific systems like agriculture or energy, capturing technological options, resource constraints, and policy interventions with high fidelity. However, holding other sectors fixed may miss important feedback effects. For instance, assuming agricultural yields will meet food demand rather than modeling yield as an endogenous outcome responding to prices and investment might overlook potential food security crises if yields fall short of assumptions.

The Pop et al. (2017) paper addresses the critical task of translating SSP narratives into spatially explicit land use projections using these IAMs. Their analysis produces projections of land use activities, their effects on the climate system, and methods for generating spatially and temporally detailed projections consistent with historical data. Key outputs include changes in crop demand reflecting population, income, and dietary preferences; cropland and pasture extent responding to yield improvements and demand; and forest cover changes from both agricultural expansion and dedicated afforestation efforts.

## The Land Use Harmonization Project

The Land Use Harmonization (LUH2) project, described in Hurtt et al. (2020), represents a monumental effort to create consistent, spatially explicit land use datasets spanning from historical reconstructions to future projections. This project addresses the critical need for continuous time series that connect historical land use patterns, beginning as early as 10,000 BCE, with future projections under different SSP-RCP combinations.

The harmonization process ensures consistency across multiple dimensions. Temporal harmonization connects historical reconstructions based on archaeological and historical evidence with contemporary observations from satellites and census data, then extends forward using IAM projections. Spatial harmonization ensures that global, regional, and grid-cell level data remain internally consistent, avoiding impossible situations like grid cells with more agricultural land than total area. Categorical harmonization translates between different land use classification systems used by various models and datasets, enabling interoperability across research communities.

The resulting LUH2 dataset provides annual, spatially explicit (0.25-degree resolution) maps of land use states and transitions from 850 CE to 2100 CE, with some scenarios extending to 2300 CE. Land use states include categories like primary forest, secondary forest, cropland, pasture, and urban areas, while transitions capture processes like deforestation, abandonment, and crop-pasture conversion. This comprehensive coverage enables Earth system models to simulate carbon cycling, biodiversity impacts, and climate feedbacks associated with land use change across centuries of human influence.

## Practical Implementation with QGIS

The hands-on component of the course introduces students to practical data manipulation using QGIS, a free and open-source geographic information system that has evolved to rival or exceed commercial alternatives like ArcGIS for many applications. The exercise begins with loading a simple land use/land cover (LULC) raster file in TIFF format, then progresses to working with complex multidimensional NetCDF files from the LUH2 dataset.

The TIFF file represents a two-dimensional matrix where each cell contains a numerical code corresponding to a specific land use class. For instance, code 90 might represent woody wetlands while code 82 indicates cultivated crops. This simple structure makes TIFF files ideal for representing spatial data at a single time point. Loading TIFF files into QGIS involves simply dragging the file into the application window, though proper visualization requires adjusting symbology settings to apply appropriate color schemes that distinguish different land use categories.

The initial display of raster data often appears in grayscale, requiring manual adjustment to create meaningful visualizations. Accessing the layer's symbology settings and selecting "single-band pseudocolor" enables application of color ramps that visually distinguish land use classes. With pixels representing 30-meter resolution in the example Willamette Valley dataset, students can examine landscape patterns at scales relevant to land management decisions, estimating distances and areas directly from the display.

## Working with Multidimensional Climate Data

The LUH2 NetCDF files introduce additional complexity through their multidimensional structure. NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) files can store multiple variables across multiple dimensions, typically including spatial dimensions (latitude and longitude), time, and potentially others like depth or height. In the LUH2 context, files contain multiple land use variables (cropland, pasture, forest types) across annual time steps from historical periods through future projections.

Loading NetCDF files into QGIS requires selecting specific variables and time slices for display, as the software cannot simultaneously visualize all dimensions. Selecting a variable like "rangeland" and a specific year creates a displayable layer showing the proportion of each grid cell covered by that land use type. Initial display often requires zooming to the layer extent and adjusting symbology settings similar to the TIFF workflow.

The resulting visualizations reveal global patterns of land use that reflect both biophysical constraints and human decisions. Rangeland concentrations in semi-arid regions unsuitable for crops, minimal rangeland in tropical forests and agricultural heartlands, and transitions zones between land use types all become visible in the spatial data. By selecting different time slices, students can observe projected changes in land use patterns under different SSP-RCP scenarios, seeing how assumptions about population, diet, technology, and policy translate into landscape transformation.

## Analytical Applications and Future Assignments

The technical skills developed through these exercises provide the foundation for subsequent analytical work. Assignment 2 will require students to explore temporal changes in land use patterns, comparing historical trends with future projections under different scenarios. This analysis reveals how scenario assumptions about agricultural intensification, dietary shifts, urbanization, and forest protection translate into spatially explicit landscape changes.

Understanding both the conceptual framework of scenarios and the practical skills for data manipulation enables students to engage critically with global change research. Rather than accepting model projections as given, students can examine how specific assumptions drive outcomes, identify which regions face the greatest land use pressures, and evaluate whether projected changes align with local knowledge and constraints.

The combination of theoretical understanding and practical skills developed in this session prepares students for more advanced topics in subsequent classes. The ability to load, visualize, and analyze spatial data will prove essential for exercises in ecosystem service modeling, where land use patterns determine service provision. Similarly, understanding scenario architecture helps interpret integrated assessment model results when examining climate economics models like DICE.

## Integration with Broader Course Themes

This lecture's focus on scenarios and land use modeling connects to broader course themes about earth economy modeling and sustainability assessment. The SSPs represent one attempt to systematically explore possible futures, acknowledging both the importance and limitations of scenario-based analysis. While scenarios cannot predict the future, they provide structured ways to think about uncertainty, identify robust strategies, and understand how current decisions shape long-term outcomes.

The technical challenges encountered in data management and visualization mirror those faced by researchers working with earth system data. File organization, format conversions, and software interoperability remain persistent challenges in interdisciplinary research. By experiencing these challenges firsthand, students develop both technical solutions and appreciation for the infrastructure required to support global change research.

The philosophical questions underlying scenario development also deserve consideration. Who decides which scenarios to develop? Whose values shape assumptions about desirable futures? How do scenario choices influence policy discussions? These questions lack simple answers but recognizing their importance helps students engage more thoughtfully with scenario-based research.

## Conclusion

This lecture has bridged conceptual understanding of scenarios with practical implementation skills, providing students with both theoretical knowledge and technical capabilities for engaging with land use change research. From the IPBES scenario typology through the specific implementation of SSPs and RCPs to hands-on data manipulation in QGIS, students now possess tools for critically examining projections of global change.

The skills developed here extend beyond the specific datasets and software introduced. Understanding how scenarios translate narratives into quantitative projections, recognizing the strengths and limitations of partial equilibrium modeling, and gaining experience with spatial data manipulation provide transferable capabilities applicable across environmental research and policy analysis.

As the course progresses toward integrated assessment models and ecosystem service evaluation, these foundational skills will prove essential. The ability to access, visualize, and interpret scenario data enables meaningful engagement with complex earth system models, moving students from passive consumers of model output to active participants in global change research. This transformation from conceptual understanding to practical capability embodies the applied nature of earth economy modeling and prepares students for independent research contributions to sustainability science.

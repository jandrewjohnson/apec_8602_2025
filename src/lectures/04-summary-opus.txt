# Lecture 4: Scenarios for the Future and Land Use Change Modeling

## Introduction and Course Context

This lecture focuses on scenarios for the future and land use change modeling, building upon the theoretical framework established in previous sessions while moving toward more specific applications and datasets. The session emphasizes practical implementation through hands-on work with QGIS software and the Land Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) dataset, marking a transition in the course toward more applied methodologies in earth economy modeling.

The course trajectory has evolved from introducing earth economy modeling and examining its origins in national sustainability models and general equilibrium approaches to now focusing on the specific scenarios that serve as inputs to these complex models. This progression reflects the pedagogical approach of moving from theoretical foundations to practical applications, ensuring students understand both the conceptual frameworks and their real-world implementations.

Looking ahead in the course schedule, the next session will shift focus toward understanding integrated assessment models for climate change through hands-on exploration. This will include examination of the DICE model developed by William Nordhaus, which despite its controversial use by climate skeptics to minimize climate change impacts, remains a foundational model in the field. The course will also explore the Green DICE Model update from Frances Moore, continuing the emphasis on practical application through direct engagement with these modeling tools. Subsequent lectures will cover inclusive wealth concepts and ecosystem services, maintaining the balance between theoretical understanding and practical implementation that characterizes this applied course approach.

## Data Organization and File Management

### Establishing a Standardized File Structure

The importance of proper file organization cannot be overstated in computational modeling and data analysis. The majority of programming errors encountered by students, particularly those new to coding, stem from incorrect file paths and misplaced data files. This fundamental issue, while seemingly trivial, can consume significant time and create frustration that detracts from learning the substantive content of the course. To address this challenge proactively, the course implements a standardized file organization system that all students must adopt.

The standardization follows best practices established in the programming community, utilizing the user directory as the foundation for file organization. This approach ensures cross-platform compatibility across Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, eliminating potential issues that arise from system-specific file path conventions. The user directory, typically located at C:\Users\[username\] on Windows systems or /Users/\[username\] on Mac systems, serves as the root location for all course-related files.

Within the user directory, students create a folder called "Files" to maintain separation from system configuration files and other program-generated content that typically populates the user directory. This Files folder serves as the container for all course materials, providing a clean organizational structure that prevents confusion with system files while maintaining accessibility for course work.

### Implementing the Base Data Structure

The core of the file organization centers on the BaseData folder, which resides within the Files directory. This folder mirrors the structure of the shared Google Drive repository, ensuring consistency between the cloud-based source and local implementations. The mirroring approach means that any file path referenced in course materials or sample code will work identically for all students, regardless of their individual system configurations.

When downloading files from the shared Google Drive repository, students must replicate the exact folder hierarchy found in the cloud storage. For instance, the LULC_CurrentWillamette.tiff file resides in the path BaseData \> Invest Sample Data \> Carbon. Students must create each of these folders in sequence, maintaining the exact naming conventions, including capitalization and spacing. This precision in folder naming prevents errors that could arise from minor variations in folder names when code attempts to access specific files.

The Google Drive Desktop Sync application offers an automated alternative to manual file downloading and organization. Students who install this application benefit from automatic synchronization that maintains the proper folder structure without manual intervention. However, recognizing that not all students may have access to sufficient storage space or prefer to install additional software, the manual download method remains the primary approach taught in the course.

## The IPBES Framework and Scenario Typology

### Understanding the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) represents a crucial international body dedicated to synthesizing current understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This organization serves as the biodiversity equivalent to the more widely known Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), addressing the historical imbalance in attention between climate change and biodiversity conservation. IPBES combines, funds, and supports scientific research in biodiversity and ecosystem services, providing a coordinated international approach to understanding and addressing biodiversity loss.

The organization gained significant recognition through the publication by Sandra Diaz and colleagues in 2015, which presented the IPBES conceptual framework. While the framework itself contains substantial theoretical complexity that extends beyond the scope of this course, its practical contribution lies in establishing a useful typology for scenarios that has become standard in the field. This typology provides a structured approach to thinking about different types of future projections and their applications in sustainability science.

### Four Types of Scenarios in Sustainability Science

The IPBES framework identifies four distinct types of scenarios, each serving different purposes in sustainability analysis and decision-making. Exploratory scenarios represent the most common understanding of scenario analysis, where researchers examine the space of possible futures from a current starting point. These scenarios explore various trajectories without prescribing specific pathways, allowing for broad investigation of potential outcomes. For instance, given observed declines in nature's benefits to people, exploratory scenarios investigate various ways this trend might continue, stabilize, or reverse, without necessarily specifying the mechanisms for achieving particular outcomes.

Target-seeking scenarios take a fundamentally different approach by starting with a specific desired outcome and working backward to identify feasible pathways to achieve that goal. The Paris Climate Agreement's target of limiting global warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius exemplifies this approach. Researchers using target-seeking scenarios examine which combinations of policies, technologies, and behavioral changes could feasibly achieve this temperature target, systematically ruling out pathways that fail to meet the specified goal. This backward-looking approach provides crucial information for policy-makers about the feasibility and requirements of achieving specific sustainability targets.

Policy screening scenarios occupy a particularly important role in applied sustainability science, as they directly evaluate the potential impacts of specific policy interventions. Researchers develop a menu of policy options, such as carbon taxes, payments for ecosystem services, or regulations banning certain activities like coal extraction, and then model the outcomes of each policy under various conditions. This approach enables systematic comparison of policy effectiveness across chosen metrics, providing evidence-based guidance for policy selection and design. The ability to test policies in a modeling environment before real-world implementation represents a crucial advantage in addressing complex sustainability challenges.

Retrospective scenarios serve a unique validation and learning function by examining policies that have already been implemented. These scenarios model what analysts expected would happen when a policy was proposed, compare those projections to actual observed outcomes, and analyze the gaps between prediction and reality. This retrospective analysis serves two critical functions: it enables model calibration to improve future predictions, and it provides insights into why certain policies succeeded or failed relative to expectations. The learning generated from retrospective scenarios feeds back into improving all other types of scenario analysis.

## Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)

### Development and Purpose of the SSPs

The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways emerged from a major collaborative effort documented in the Riahi et al. 2017 paper, involving multiple research teams and stakeholders working to define a comprehensive set of scenarios for assessing biodiversity and nature's future. The SSPs were explicitly designed to provide for broader sustainability questions what the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) had achieved for climate change analysis. While RCPs focus specifically on greenhouse gas concentration trajectories and their climate impacts, SSPs encompass a much broader range of socioeconomic factors including population dynamics, economic development, urbanization patterns, and productivity trends.

The development process for the SSPs involved extensive stakeholder engagement to define different storylines or narratives about possible futures. These narratives go beyond simple quantitative projections to include qualitative descriptions of how societies might evolve, what values might predominate, and how international cooperation might develop or deteriorate. The storylines provide context and coherence to what would otherwise be disconnected numerical projections, helping users understand the internal logic of each scenario.

These narrative storylines undergo translation into specific quantitative drivers that can be incorporated into models. Population projections, urbanization rates, productivity growth, and technological development rates all flow from the underlying narratives, ensuring internal consistency within each scenario. Policy assumptions are also incorporated, allowing for policy screening within the broader scenario framework. The result is a comprehensive set of country-level projections for both inputs like GDP and population, and outputs like energy supply and demand patterns and land use change trajectories.

### The Two-Dimensional Challenge Space

The SSPs are conceptualized within a two-dimensional space that captures the fundamental challenges facing climate action. The vertical axis represents mitigation challenges, referring to the difficulty of preventing climate change through emission reductions or renewable energy deployment. Low mitigation challenges indicate conditions where transitioning to low-carbon systems is relatively easy and affordable, while high mitigation challenges suggest substantial barriers to emission reductions, whether technological, economic, or political.

The horizontal axis captures adaptation challenges, representing the difficulty of managing climate change impacts through measures like infrastructure improvements, agricultural adaptation, or public health interventions. Low adaptation challenges suggest societies with strong institutions, adequate resources, and equitable distribution systems that can effectively respond to climate impacts. High adaptation challenges indicate vulnerable populations, weak institutions, or resource constraints that limit adaptive capacity.

This two-dimensional framework creates distinct regions with different implications for climate action. The lower-left corner represents the most favorable conditions, with low challenges for both mitigation and adaptation, suggesting a world well-equipped to both prevent and manage climate change. The upper-right corner represents the most challenging conditions, where both preventing and adapting to climate change face substantial obstacles. The off-diagonal corners present interesting asymmetries: high mitigation challenges with low adaptation challenges might represent a fossil fuel-dependent world with strong institutions and resources for adaptation, while low mitigation challenges with high adaptation challenges might occur if renewable energy becomes cheap but inequality and weak institutions limit adaptive capacity.

### Specific SSP Narratives and Characteristics

Each SSP carries a distinctive narrative that shapes its quantitative projections. SSP1, titled "Sustainability - Taking the Green Road," represents a world that successfully addresses both environmental and social challenges through global cooperation, technological innovation, and shifts toward sustainable consumption patterns. This scenario assumes strong international institutions, reduced inequality, and successful transitions to renewable energy and sustainable land use practices.

SSP2, "Middle of the Road," represents a continuation of current trends without dramatic shifts in either positive or negative directions. This scenario serves as a baseline or business-as-usual projection, assuming moderate progress on some sustainability challenges while others remain unresolved. Economic and social development proceeds unevenly, with some countries achieving sustainability goals while others lag behind.

SSP3, "A Rocky Road - Regional Rivalry," depicts a world fragmenting into regional blocks with limited cooperation on global challenges. Countries prioritize national security and economic competitiveness over environmental protection, leading to material-intensive consumption, slow technological progress on sustainability, and increasing inequality both within and between nations. This scenario represents high challenges for both mitigation and adaptation.

SSP4, "A Road Divided - Inequality," explores a world of increasing disparities both within and between countries. While some regions and populations achieve high levels of development and successfully address environmental challenges, others are left behind, lacking resources and capacity for either mitigation or adaptation. This scenario highlights how inequality can undermine global sustainability efforts even when some actors are highly capable.

SSP5, "Fossil-fueled Development - Taking the Highway," presents a paradoxical scenario of rapid economic growth and technological development powered primarily by fossil fuels. While this leads to high emissions and significant climate change, the economic prosperity and technological capability enable substantial adaptation efforts. This scenario explores whether societies can successfully adapt to severe climate change through technology and wealth, essentially creating climate-controlled environments for human habitation.

## Integration of SSPs with Representative Concentration Pathways

### Understanding RCP-SSP Combinations

The integration of SSPs with RCPs creates a matrix of possible future scenarios that combine socioeconomic development pathways with climate forcing outcomes. RCPs are expressed numerically as watts per square meter of radiative forcing, with values ranging from 1.9 (very low forcing and minimal climate change) to 8.5 (high forcing and severe climate change). While not precisely equivalent to temperature increases, these values provide a useful approximation of climate change severity.

Theoretically, any SSP can be combined with any RCP, creating a vast space of possible scenarios. However, certain combinations are more plausible than others. For instance, SSP1's sustainable development narrative aligns naturally with lower RCP values, while SSP3's regional rivalry and limited cooperation makes higher RCP values more likely. Despite this logical alignment, the framework allows for exploration of seemingly contradictory combinations, such as sustainable development with high emissions or fossil-fueled development with low emissions, though achieving these combinations would require specific conditions or policies.

Practical constraints limit the number of SSP-RCP combinations that are fully developed and modeled. Computational limitations, resource constraints, and the need for tractable analysis lead to the selection of marker scenarios that represent specific SSP-RCP pairs. These marker scenarios, designated by combining the SSP and RCP numbers (e.g., SSP126 for SSP1 with RCP2.6, or SSP585 for SSP5 with RCP8.5), receive the most detailed analysis and are most commonly used in research and policy applications.

### Implications for Energy and Land Use Projections

The SSP-RCP combinations generate specific projections for critical sustainability outcomes, particularly in energy production and land use patterns. Energy projections vary dramatically across scenarios, with different trajectories for the mix of oil and gas, coal, renewables, and nuclear power. The primary energy triangle visualization effectively captures these transitions, showing how energy sources shift over time under different scenarios. Historical patterns show transitions from biomass to coal during industrialization, then diversification to include oil and gas, with future scenarios diverging based on whether renewable energy expands rapidly (as in SSP1) or fossil fuels continue to dominate (as in SSP5).

Land use projections similarly vary across SSP-RCP combinations, reflecting different assumptions about agricultural intensification, dietary transitions, urbanization patterns, and forest conservation. For instance, scenarios with high crop yield improvements may require less agricultural land, potentially allowing for reforestation or habitat restoration. Conversely, scenarios with growing meat consumption and limited yield improvements may drive agricultural expansion into natural ecosystems. These land use trajectories have profound implications for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the carbon cycle.

## Integrated Assessment Models and the SSPs

### Model Architecture and Capabilities

The SSP projections are generated using sophisticated Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that combine representations of human and natural systems. The primary models used with the SSPs include AIM (Asia-Pacific Integrated Model), GCAM (Global Change Assessment Model), IMAGE (Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment), MESSAGE-GLOBIOM, and REMIND-MAgPIE. Each model has unique strengths and approaches, but all solve complex optimization problems to project future development pathways that meet specified objectives while respecting various constraints.

These models typically employ partial equilibrium approaches, meaning they represent certain sectors in great detail while treating others as exogenous or simplified. This contrasts with general equilibrium models that attempt to capture all economic interactions simultaneously. The partial equilibrium approach allows for much greater detail in key sectors like agriculture, energy, and land use, but may miss important feedback effects between sectors. For instance, a model might detail agricultural production and land use decisions while treating industrial development as an external input rather than an outcome influenced by agricultural patterns.

The models solve cost-minimization problems subject to various constraints, seeking efficient pathways to meet demands for food, energy, and other goods and services while respecting resource limitations and policy constraints. This optimization framework assumes rational economic actors and efficient markets, assumptions that may not hold in reality but provide useful benchmarks for analysis. The models can incorporate various policy instruments, technological options, and behavioral changes, allowing for extensive exploration of intervention strategies.

### Limitations and Considerations

A critical limitation of partial equilibrium models lies in their treatment of key constraints and assumptions. These models often assume that certain fundamental challenges are resolved, then explore what additional actions are needed. For example, models might assume that agricultural yields will be sufficient to feed the global population, treating yield as an exogenous input rather than an endogenous outcome influenced by climate change, soil degradation, and other factors. If yields fall short of assumptions, the models may not capture resulting food security crises or land use pressures.

The assumption of economic optimization and rational behavior may not reflect real-world decision-making, which is influenced by cultural values, political constraints, institutional failures, and behavioral biases. Models may underestimate transaction costs, implementation challenges, and resistance to change that characterize real-world transitions. These limitations don't invalidate the models but suggest caution in interpreting results and the need for complementary analyses that address these gaps.

Despite limitations, IAMs paired with SSPs provide invaluable insights into possible futures and the implications of different development pathways. They offer internally consistent, quantitative projections that can inform policy debates and identify key leverage points for intervention. The models help identify trade-offs between objectives, unexpected consequences of policies, and conditions necessary for achieving sustainability goals.

## The Land Use Harmonization Project

### Connecting Historical Data with Future Projections

The Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2), described in Hurtt et al. 2020, represents a monumental effort to create consistent, spatially explicit land use datasets spanning from historical reconstructions to future projections. The project addresses a critical need in Earth system modeling for land use data that maintains consistency across the historical-future transition, enables model intercomparison, and provides the spatial and temporal resolution required for contemporary modeling applications.

The historical component of LUH2 extends back to 10,000 BCE, reconstructing land use transitions based on archaeological evidence, historical records, and modeling of agricultural expansion and intensification. This deep historical perspective provides context for understanding current land use patterns and rates of change, while also serving as validation data for models that must reproduce historical transitions before projecting futures. The historical reconstruction reveals the acceleration of land use change with industrialization and population growth, providing baselines for assessing future scenarios.

The future component incorporates the SSP-RCP scenarios, translating the aggregate land use projections from IAMs into spatially explicit, grid-cell level changes. This translation involves sophisticated downscaling algorithms that respect local constraints, historical patterns, and biophysical suitability while achieving aggregate targets. The resulting datasets provide annual, half-degree resolution global land use maps for multiple land use categories including cropland, pasture, forest, and urban areas.

### Data Structure and Applications

The LUH2 dataset employs a state-and-transition framework that tracks both land use states (the amount of each land use type) and transitions between states (the annual flows between land use categories). This framework captures the dynamics of land use change, including gross transitions that may be masked in net change analyses. For instance, simultaneous forest loss in one region and forest gain in another might result in little net forest change, but the gross transitions have important implications for carbon cycling, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.

The dataset uses the NetCDF format, a standard in climate and Earth system modeling that enables efficient storage and access of multidimensional data. Each file contains multiple variables (different land use types), multiple time steps (annual data), and global coverage at half-degree resolution. This structure allows users to extract specific variables, time periods, or regions as needed for their applications. The standardized format ensures compatibility with major Earth system models and analysis tools.

Applications of LUH2 data span numerous research domains and practical applications. Climate modelers use the data to account for land use impacts on carbon cycling, surface energy balance, and atmospheric chemistry. Biodiversity researchers apply the data to assess habitat loss, fragmentation, and species exposure to land use change. Agricultural scientists use the projections to evaluate food security, water resources, and sustainable intensification strategies. Policy makers reference the scenarios to understand implications of different development pathways and identify intervention opportunities.

## Practical Implementation with QGIS

### Working with Land Use/Land Cover Data

The practical component of the course introduces students to working with actual land use data using QGIS, a free and open-source geographic information system that has become increasingly popular in academic and professional settings. QGIS provides capabilities comparable to commercial alternatives like ArcGIS while offering the advantages of open-source software including free access, community support, and extensibility. The software handles various data formats common in land use analysis, including raster data (like TIFF files) and multidimensional datasets (like NetCDF files).

The LULC_CurrentWillamette.tiff file serves as an introduction to raster land use data. This file contains a two-dimensional matrix where each cell holds a numerical value representing a specific land use class. The classification system assigns unique numbers to different land use types: 90 for woody wetlands, 82 for cultivated crops, and so forth. This numerical encoding allows for efficient storage and processing while maintaining categorical information about land use types. The 30-meter resolution of this dataset provides sufficient detail for landscape-level analysis while remaining computationally manageable.

Loading and visualizing this data in QGIS demonstrates fundamental GIS operations that students will use throughout the course. The drag-and-drop interface simplifies data loading, while the symbology tools enable customization of visualization to highlight patterns of interest. Converting from the default grayscale display to a pseudocolor representation using appropriate color ramps makes land use patterns immediately visible and interpretable. The ability to zoom, pan, and query individual pixels provides interactive exploration of the data, helping students develop intuition about land use patterns and spatial relationships.

### Exploring Temporal Dynamics with LUH2 Data

The LUH2 NetCDF files introduce additional complexity through their temporal dimension, containing annual land use data spanning historical reconstructions and future projections. This multidimensional structure requires more sophisticated handling than simple raster files, as users must specify which variables and time steps to visualize. QGIS handles this complexity through a selection interface that allows users to choose specific variables (such as cropland, rangeland, or forest) and specific years from the time series.

The rangeland variable provides an illustrative example of the data's content and utility. Each pixel contains the proportion of that grid cell covered by rangeland, ranging from 0 (no rangeland) to 1 (complete rangeland coverage). This proportional representation acknowledges that half-degree grid cells (approximately 55 km at the equator) contain mixtures of land use types rather than homogeneous coverage. Visualizing rangeland distribution reveals global patterns such as the extensive rangelands of central Asia, Australia, and parts of Africa, contrasting with the minimal rangeland in tropical forests or intensive agricultural regions like the U.S. Corn Belt.

The temporal dimension enables analysis of land use change over time, a critical capability for understanding trends and projecting futures. By selecting different time bands within the same dataset, students can observe how land use patterns evolve under different scenarios. For instance, comparing rangeland extent in 2020 versus 2100 under different SSPs reveals dramatically different trajectories depending on assumptions about agricultural intensification, dietary choices, and conservation policies. This temporal analysis provides concrete illustrations of how different development pathways lead to different environmental outcomes.

## Synthesis and Future Applications

### Connecting Concepts to Applications

The integration of conceptual frameworks, quantitative scenarios, and practical data analysis tools provides students with a comprehensive toolkit for engaging with land use and sustainability challenges. Understanding the IPBES scenario typology enables appropriate selection of analytical approaches for different questions. Familiarity with the SSPs and their underlying assumptions allows critical evaluation of projections and their applicability to specific contexts. Hands-on experience with actual datasets and GIS tools transforms abstract concepts into concrete analytical capabilities.

This foundation prepares students for increasingly sophisticated analyses in subsequent course modules. Future assignments will build on these basics to explore topics such as ecosystem service modeling, where land use scenarios drive changes in carbon storage, water provision, and biodiversity habitat. Students will learn to couple land use projections with process models to assess impacts on specific sustainability outcomes. The combination of scenario analysis and spatial modeling provides powerful capabilities for evaluating policy options and identifying sustainable development pathways.

### Implications for Sustainability Science and Practice

The tools and concepts covered in this lecture have immediate relevance for contemporary sustainability challenges. The Paris Agreement's global stocktake process relies on scenarios like the SSPs to assess collective progress toward climate goals. National and subnational governments use land use scenarios to develop territorial plans that balance development needs with environmental protection. Conservation organizations apply these approaches to identify priority areas for protection under different development scenarios.

The limitations and uncertainties inherent in scenario analysis also carry important lessons. No model or scenario can perfectly predict the future, and all projections embed assumptions that may prove incorrect. However, the value of scenarios lies not in prediction but in systematic exploration of possibilities, identification of robust strategies that perform well across multiple futures, and recognition of key uncertainties that require monitoring and adaptive management. By engaging with both the power and limitations of these tools, students develop the critical thinking necessary for effective sustainability practice.

The increasing availability of open-source tools like QGIS and freely accessible datasets like LUH2 democratizes access to sophisticated analytical capabilities that were once restricted to well-resourced institutions. This democratization enables broader participation in sustainability analysis and decision-making, potentially leading to more inclusive and locally relevant solutions. As students develop proficiency with these tools, they join a global community of researchers and practitioners working toward sustainable futures, equipped with shared frameworks, data, and analytical approaches that enable collaboration across disciplines and borders.
